# Python-for-Data-Analysis

The Python projects in this folder exemplify how I work with Python for data analysis and data science projects. These projects include the use of pandas, numpy, and web scraping to create and work with various data frames, as well as the use of various Python data visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, cufflinks, etc.) to create informative visualizations of those data frames to help solve business questions.

Most of these projects were completed as coursework for the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning course by Jose Portilla (Pieran Training) hosted on Udemy.
